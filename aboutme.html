        <p>
          Hello there, creator of Saiyan Blue here. If you happen to read this page then you’re very lucky, because not many people will find this and read it. In this short section, I will tell you my story, specifically my YouTube journey
          in achieving more than 270K subscribers on The Saiyan Blue channel.
        </p>
        <p>
          This journey is definitely not easy, it took me weeks if not months to reach this point of having a successful channel. And to be honest, this is also not my first YouTube channel, I have started many other channels with all
          different sorts of content before. Contents that I have uploaded range from making videos in reverse to how to edit videos in Imovie, yes it was very random but I enjoy every second of making it. And it’s also funny looking back
          at my old videos from 2 years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this YouTube stuff started when Covid hits. When Covid hits and everything goes online, I have a lot of free time to spend at home. And I am always obsessed with having a YouTube channel. At that time, I wasn’t thinking
          about making money or starting a business out of YouTube, I just wanted to be on YouTube and be a YouTuber. And so, first I started a channel on how to make paper figures like a paper airplane, paper frog, etc and I also made a
          reverse of those videos and uploaded them. Making these videos was fun and I really enjoyed editing them, although the videos weren’t watched by people. After knowing that this type of content failed, I started making other types
          of content from music to online games to poggers(what?) to Minecraft videos to reuploading TikTok content, and finally AMV videos. It was when I started making AMV content, my videos started to blow up. Since editing videos has
          been second nature to me, making AMV content was very enjoyable and fun. Some of my videos had more than 400K likes and 2M views! And that's really crazy. But it is also thanks to you guys that watched my videos and helped me to
          reach this point.
        </p>
        <p>All in all, my tip for you all aspiring young YouTubers is that don’t focus too much on your subscribers or views. Instead, focus on your system, make sure to upload consistently, and improve your videos over time.</p>
        <p>And yeah that’s it about me, make sure to visit my channel here.</p>
